Reading: 0 Writing: 1 Waiting: 0 

active connections -- number of all open connections including 
connections to backends

server accepts handled requests -- nginx accepted 16630948 connections, 
handled 16630948 connections (no one was closed just it was accepted), 
and handles 31070465 requests (1.8 requests per connection)

reading -- nginx reads request header

writing -- nginx reads request body, processes request, or writes 
response to a client

waiting -- keep-alive connections, actually it is active - (reading + 
writing)
